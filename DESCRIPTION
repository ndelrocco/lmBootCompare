Description: The primary purpose of this package is to compare the bootstrapped sampling distributions
     of linear regression coefficients obtained using six different methods. Case resampling, 
     residual resampling, Wild bootstrap with Mammen's Two-Point Distribution, Wild bootstrap 
     with Mammen's Continuous Distribution, Wild boostrap with Rademacher Distribution, and Wild
     bootstrap with Standard Normal Distribution are supported. There are four main functions in this 
     package to facilitate this. bootstrapSamples(), bootstrapSummary(), bootstrapConfint(), and 
     coefficientPlots(). These functions generate samples, calculate summary statistics, calculate 
     confidence intervals for parameters, and visualize the sampling distributions (respectively). 
     This allows the user to compare the results of different sampling approaches simultaneously 
     with ease.
